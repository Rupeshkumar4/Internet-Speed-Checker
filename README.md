# Internet-Speed-Checker
<h3>An Internet speed test (also known as a broadband speed test) is a measure of the rate at which data is downloaded and uploaded. It also measures how long it takes to get a response to a signal from a device to a test server. Loading speed is measured in megabits per second, and the response time or latency is measured in milliseconds. Internet speed tests are often available as a free online tool provided by communication service providers and routing companies.</h3>
